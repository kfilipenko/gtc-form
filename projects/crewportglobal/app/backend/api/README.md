# CrewPortGlobal Backend API (CPG-BE-002)

## Scope

This directory contains the first implementation slice for registration draft endpoints and reviewed public vacancy publication.

- CPG-BE-002: registration draft API endpoints

The current implementation provides runtime handlers and DB writes for draft create/get/update, operator review decisions and reviewed vacancy listing.

## Planned endpoints

- POST /api/v1/registration/drafts
- GET /api/v1/registration/drafts/{draft_id}
- PATCH /api/v1/registration/drafts/{draft_id}
- GET /api/v1/operator/review-queue
- PATCH /api/v1/operator/review-queue/{draft_id}/status
- GET /api/v1/vacancies
- GET /api/v1/health

## Current status

- endpoint contracts: created
- handler stubs: retained as behavior notes
- runtime router/handlers: implemented in public/index.php
- persistence logic: minimal DB writes implemented for draft flow
- vacancy publication logic: public vacancies are returned only when the vacancy is published and the employer company is verified
- auth/session logic: not implemented

## Local run example

```bash
cd projects/crewportglobal/app/backend/api/public
php -S 127.0.0.1:8091 router.php
```

Then call endpoints under:

- http://127.0.0.1:8091/api/v1/registration/drafts
- http://127.0.0.1:8091/api/v1/registration/drafts/{draft_id}
- http://127.0.0.1:8091/api/v1/operator/review-queue
- http://127.0.0.1:8091/api/v1/vacancies

## Integration tests

Run the API-focused Playwright suite from repository root:

```bash
npm run test:cpg-api
```

This suite starts the API web server, applies the registration and vacancy migrations,
and verifies health/create/get/patch, operator decisions, reviewed vacancy publication and validation error cases.
