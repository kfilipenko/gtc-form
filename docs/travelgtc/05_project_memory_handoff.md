# TravelGTC - Project Memory Handoff

- Project: TravelGTC
- Project code: travelgtc
- Domain: travelgtc.com
- Owner: GTC INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FZ-LLC
- Version: 0.6
- Date: 2026-07-08
- Status: Active, typography aligned and mockup images removed from public content

## 1. Current State

TravelGTC was initialized as a new GTC website project.

The final accepted concept is:

```text
Travel Network Lab
```

Meaning: a modern travel club / travel network where a person can travel, create routes, gather people and develop a partner network.

Project Owner added first visual references to:

```text
projects/travelgtc/public/assets/images/inbox/foto/
```

Current implemented direction: travel network / club / community platform where people create travel ideas, gather others, join trips/events, use partner opportunities and develop a network-based travel business without aggressive MLM language.

Created project areas:

```text
docs/travelgtc/
projects/travelgtc/
projects/travelgtc/public/assets/images/inbox/
projects/travelgtc/public/assets/images/processed/
projects/travelgtc/public/legal/
```

First public prototype routes:

```text
/
/travel-lifestyle/
/club/
/create-trip/
/business-model/
/events/
/about/
/contacts/
```

Server-side publication is prepared:

```text
Live root: /var/www/travelgtc.com
Nginx source template: projects/travelgtc/deploy/nginx/travelgtc.com.conf
Nginx installed config: /etc/nginx/sites-available/travelgtc.com.conf
Deploy script: projects/travelgtc/scripts/deploy_public_live.sh
```

Current blocker for public domain:

```text
Authoritative Timeweb DNS points to 20.91.187.79.
Some public recursive DNS caches may temporarily keep old Timeweb A/AAAA records.
SSL is issued for travelgtc.com and www.travelgtc.com.
```

Current visual asset rule:

```text
Mockups in projects/travelgtc/public/assets/images/inbox/foto/ are design references only.
They must not be displayed as real public website images.
Production images should be generated/selected, approved, optimized and placed in processed/.
Prompts: docs/travelgtc/009_travelgtc_visual_asset_generation_prompts.md
```

## 2. Working Rules

1. Start each new TravelGTC task by reading this memory document and `docs/travelgtc/00_documentation_register.md`.
2. Use the GTC project delivery standards in `docs/gtc_project_delivery_standard/`.
3. Keep source images in `projects/travelgtc/public/assets/images/inbox/`.
4. Move optimized and approved images to `projects/travelgtc/public/assets/images/processed/`.
5. Public pages should stay action-first: travel dream, community, then business opportunity.
6. Do not collect real personal data before privacy/consent and backend handling are defined.
7. Fix meaningful changes with documentation updates, verification and git commit.

## 3. Next Recommended Step

Recommended next steps:

1. wait for recursive DNS caches to stop returning old Timeweb A/AAAA values;
2. run live HTTPS smoke checks without forced DNS;
3. generate and provide production images using the prompt document;
4. publish approved images into `projects/travelgtc/public/assets/images/processed/`;
5. confirm production contact links for MAX, Telegram and email;
6. define privacy/consent and backend/CRM handling for forms.
